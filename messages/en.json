        "features": "The agent forms a tight, solid covering over the mold and a layer of vaporized agent over the covering for double protection. Because the agent contains no oil, it leaves almost no stains on molded articles. The agent can be removed by applying several preliminary shots.",
        "application": "The agent prevents rust on the molds when oil should be avoided or as a substitute for grease or antirust oil that is difficult to remove. Close the molds and then pack and seal them in a plastic bag so that the vaporized agent does not diffuse into the air but remains around the molds for the desired effect."
